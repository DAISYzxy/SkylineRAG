Please use the following listed aspects and their descriptions as evaluation criteria: \\n - Accuracy and Hallucinations: The assistant’s answer is semantically consistent with the gold answer; The numerical value and order need to be accurate, and there should be no hallucinations. \\n- Completeness: Referring to the reference answers, the assistant’s answer should contain all the key points needed to answer the user’s question; further elaboration on these key points can be omitted. Please rate whether this answer is suitable for the question. Please note that the gold answer can be considered as a correct answer to the question. The assistant receives an overall score on a scale of 1 to 100, where a higher score indicates better overall performance.Please note that if the assistant’s answer and the gold answer fully meet the above criteria, its overall rating should be the full marks (100). Please first provide a comprehensive explanation of your evaluation, avoiding any potential bias.Then, output a line indicating the score of the Assistant.
